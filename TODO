Where do i randomly select a song in react?
How to play song?
	use POST /v1/me/player/play. cann pass in context uri of playlist.
how to shuffle playlist?


have playlist uri

start can just play whatever is playing on current user?
	hit start button sends /play request

or start passes is {play: true} to Player
	player determines whether there is a selection otherwise continue playing current context
	DO THIS ^

Current problems:
	cannot pass this.state.playlistURI to SpotifyControl
	cannot pass isPlaying to SpotifyControl

MVP working.

Next:
    - auto advance art when next song plays
	- make fullscreen images bigger
	- spotify play error message
	- escape out of full screen also stops music
	- start button chooses device of current browser
	- find button is broken. plays music and goes to full screen.
    - end gracefully

$ npm run deploy

need to pass currentIndex between to mainframe


After escaping, buttons are weird. hitting random starts experience again.
